# Nekomata 60

Started from the fork of [kkatano's bakeneko-60 project](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60). 

I'm starting this project in the face of the difficulty of finding a good 60% PCB with Bluetooth. It will probably never be completed, but it's primarily a personal challenge to master KiCAD.

## Coming features

- **Based on the nRF52840 SoC**
- **Wireless through Bluetooth**
- **Khail hot swap socket**
- Single piece tray case
- O-ring gasket mount (Friction fit)
- [Unified Daughterboard](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard)
- **ZMK firmware**
- Compatible with common 60% plates
- PCB designed with KiCAD

## Specs

- Dimensions: 295 x 110 x 30mm
- Front height: 18.5mm
- Home row height: 31mm(with GMK keycaps and bumpons)
- Typing angle: 6 degree
- Weight:
  - PLA Case: 370g
  - Aluminum Case: 700g
- O-ring gasket: VMQ-50(Silicone 50 duro) AS568-262
